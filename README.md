# password-generator

## Description 

For this week boot camp challenge, I had to come up with a algorithm for a tool that generate random password based on user inputs. In order to achieve this, I used functions, objects, loops and conditional statements to meet the design requirements. The algorithm has been thoroughly tested for bugs and non-valid user inputs.

## Design requirement

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
